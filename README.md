# 🎱 Joystick-Controlled Ball Balancer

This is a **prototype version** of my fully automated ball balancer.  
It uses **joystick control** to test the **mechanical design** and **mathematical model** before moving to camera-based automation.

---

## ✨ Features
- 3-servo platform for ball balancing  
- Joystick input to manually test responsiveness  
- SolidWorks CAD models of the platform and linkages  
- Arduino code for servo control  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SolidWorks** – CAD modeling and design  
- **Arduino IDE (C++)** – servo control code  
- **Git/GitHub** – version control and documentation  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add **computer vision** for ball tracking (OpenCV + ESP32-CAM)  
- Implement **PID control** for automatic stabilization  
- Refine CAD models for smoother and more reliable operation

## 📷 Demo (Coming Soon!)
_A short video or gif of the joystick-controlled prototype will be added here._
