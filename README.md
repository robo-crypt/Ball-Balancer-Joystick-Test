# 🎱 Joystick-Controlled Ball Balancer

This is a **prototype version** of my fully automated ball balancer.  
It uses **joystick control** to test the **mechanical design** and **mathematical model** before moving to camera-based automation.

### 🎥 Prototype Validation – Joystick Control

This video demonstrates joystick-based manual control of the ball balancing platform, used to validate the mechanical design, servo actuation, and overall system responsiveness before implementing camera-based automatic control.
